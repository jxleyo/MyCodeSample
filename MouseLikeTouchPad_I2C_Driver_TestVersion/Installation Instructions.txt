MouseLikeTouchPad_I2C Hid Driver for windows·ÂÊó±êÊ½´¥Ãþ°åÇý¶¯

The MouseLikeTouchPad is a touchpad technology implementation that simulates the function of the mouse. The current logic implementation version is optimized and improved again by the inventor based on the patented technology of the mouse like touchpad according to the natural state of human fingers during operation. 3 fingers refers to the completion of the operation of the left / right / middle keys of the mouse. The fingers correspond to the functions of various buttons and other parts of the mouse one by one. The middle finger corresponds to the pointer locator of the mouse, The index finger corresponds to the left button and the middle button of the mouse (when the index finger and the middle finger are separated, it is defined as the left button of the mouse, and when the index finger and the middle finger are close together, it is defined as the middle button of the mouse), the ring finger corresponds to the right button of the mouse, and the middle finger ring finger or the middle finger and the index finger 2 together after quick touch correspond to the vertical wheel and the horizontal wheel of the mouse during sliding operation. Pressing the physical key at the lower left corner of the touch panel with a single finger is the backward function key of the mouse, Pressing the physical key at the lower right corner of the touch panel with a single finger is the forward function key of the mouse, pressing the middle physical key at the lower edge of the touch panel with a single finger is to adjust the DPI sensitivity of the mouse (slow / medium / fast 3-stage sensitivity), and pressing the physical key at the lower edge of the touch panel with a double finger is the wheel switch (turning on the mouse wheel and the touch pad gesture function is convenient for daily application and operation, and temporarily turning off the mouse wheel and the touch pad gesture function to reduce the misoperation rate of the game), Pressing the physical key on the lower edge of the touch pad with three fingers is the operation mode to switch the wheel (accurate touch pad two finger sliding gesture / imitating the wheel operation of the mouse, which is convenient for a few applications with poor support for the two finger sliding of the touch pad, such as PTC Creo, which can use the simulated mouse wheel operation), Press the physical key on the lower edge of the touch panel with four fingers to switch the operation mode of the mouse like touch panel (when it is closed, it will revert to the original touch panel mode of the windows system to facilitate the use of other users who have not learned the operation method of the mouse like touch panel. At the same time, it can also reflect the power of the mouse like touch panel drive through comparison).

The multi-point capacitive touch pad can easily solve the wrong touch of the palm according to the shape of the contact surface of the touch point (the aspect ratio of the elliptical contact surface of the palm supported by the touch pad during typing is larger than that of the normal finger, so it is easy to eliminate the filter).

In addition, only the touch panel with Parallel Report Mode hardware has the function of switching back to the original windows touch panel operation mode. The problem with the original touch panel gesture operation of Hybrid ReportingMode hardware has not been solved, so the function of switching back to the original touch panel operation mode is not realized. The double finger sliding wheel operation has a jam, so the default setting is to imitate the mouse wheel mode.

The free experience beta driver uses an unofficially issued third-party digital signature certificate, so the windows security center will pop up a warning threat. Select "allow on the device" and no window will pop up. The officially issued shared charging version uses a Microsoft Certified Digital signature certificate. It is safer and easier to install without a warning pop-up window.
