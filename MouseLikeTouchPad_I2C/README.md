MouseLikeTouchPad_I2C Hid Driver for windows10仿鼠标式触摸板驱动

仿鼠标式触摸板是一种模拟鼠标功能的触摸板技术实现，当前的逻辑实现版本是发明人基于仿鼠标触摸板专利技术根据人手指操作时自然状态再次优化改进而成，3指完成鼠标左键/右键/中键和指针的操作，手指与鼠标的各个按键等部件的功能一一对应，其中的中指对应鼠标的指针定位器，食指对应鼠标左键和中键（食指与中指分开时定义为鼠标左键，食指与中指并拢时定义为鼠标中键），无名指对应鼠标右键，中指无名指或者中指与食指2指一起快速触摸后滑动操作时对应鼠标垂直滚轮和水平滚轮，单指重按触控板左下角物理键为鼠标的后退功能键，单指重按触控板右下角物理键为鼠标的前进功能键，单指重按触控板下沿中间物理键为调节鼠标DPI灵敏度（慢/中等/快3段灵敏度），双指重按触控板下沿物理键为滚轮开关（开启鼠标滚轮及触摸板手势功能方便日常应用操作，临时关闭鼠标滚轮及触摸板手势功能以降低游戏误操作率），三指重按触控板下沿物理键为切换滚轮的操作方式（精确式触摸板双指滑动手势/模仿鼠标的滚轮操作，方便少数对触控板双指滑动支持差的应用如PTC Creo可以使用模仿的鼠标滚轮操作），四指重按触控板下沿物理键为切换仿鼠标式触摸板操作方式的开关（关闭时恢复为windows系统原本的触控板方式以方便其他未学习仿鼠标式触摸板操作方法的用户使用，同时也能通过对比体现出仿鼠标式触摸板驱动的强大之处）。

手指与鼠标按键功能定义规则： 
根据鼠标左键/中键普遍用食指操作的习惯、手指自然状态来区分确定鼠标左键/右键/中键操作与滚动操作；中指对应鼠标的指针定位器；中指被定义为指针后食指首次接触到触控板的时间与中指定义为指针的时间差超过阈值常量时食指操作定义 为鼠标左键或中键（食指与中指为分开状态时食指操作定义为鼠标左键，食指与中指并拢状态时食指操作定义为鼠标中键，左键和中键互相切换需要抬起食指后进行改变，即食指与中指在分开、并拢状态之间滑动切换时左键中键定义保持不变）；中指被定义为指针后无名指首次接触到触控板的时间与中指定义为指针的时间差超过阈值常量时无名指操作定义为鼠标右键，指针被定义后无名指/食指首次接触到触控板的时间与中指定义为指针的时间差小于阈值常量时（中指无名指或者中指与食指2指一起快速触摸后滑动操作）定义为鼠标垂直或水平滚轮（正常情况中指无名指或者中指与食指2指一起滑动操作的舒适性最高）。

多点电容式触摸板根据触摸点接触面形状很容易解决手掌的误触（打字时触摸板支撑手掌的椭圆接触面的长宽比特征比正常手指大所以很容易排除过滤掉）。
本驱动只适合部分匹配的笔记本电脑型号，硬件兼容标准以安装成功并运行正常来判别，另外只有采用Parallel Report Mode并行报告模式硬件的触控板有切换回windows原版触摸板操作方式的功能，Hybrid ReportingMode混合报告模式硬件的原版触摸板手势操作存在问题未解决所以不实现其切换回原版触摸板操作方式功能并且双指滑动滚轮操作有卡顿所以默认设置为模仿鼠标滚轮方式。
 免费体验的测试版驱动因为采用非正式发行的第三方数字签名证书所以windows安全中心会弹出警告威胁选择“允许在设备上”即可不弹出窗口，正式发行的共享收费版本采用微软认证的数字签名证书无警告弹窗安装更安全简便。

MouseLikeTouchPad_I2C Hid Driver for windows仿鼠标式触摸板驱动

The MouseLikeTouchPad is a touchpad technology implementation that simulates the function of the mouse. The current logic implementation version is optimized and improved again by the inventor based on the patented technology of the mouse like touchpad according to the natural state of human fingers during operation. 3 fingers refers to the completion of the operation of the left / right / middle keys of the mouse. The fingers correspond to the functions of various buttons and other parts of the mouse one by one. The middle finger corresponds to the pointer locator of the mouse, The index finger corresponds to the left button and the middle button of the mouse (when the index finger and the middle finger are separated, it is defined as the left button of the mouse, and when the index finger and the middle finger are close together, it is defined as the middle button of the mouse), the ring finger corresponds to the right button of the mouse, and the middle finger ring finger or the middle finger and the index finger 2 together after quick touch correspond to the vertical wheel and the horizontal wheel of the mouse during sliding operation. Pressing the physical key at the lower left corner of the touch panel with a single finger is the backward function key of the mouse, Pressing the physical key at the lower right corner of the touch panel with a single finger is the forward function key of the mouse, pressing the middle physical key at the lower edge of the touch panel with a single finger is to adjust the DPI sensitivity of the mouse (slow / medium / fast 3-stage sensitivity), and pressing the physical key at the lower edge of the touch panel with a double finger is the wheel switch (turning on the mouse wheel and the touch pad gesture function is convenient for daily application and operation, and temporarily turning off the mouse wheel and the touch pad gesture function to reduce the misoperation rate of the game), Pressing the physical key on the lower edge of the touch pad with three fingers is the operation mode to switch the wheel (accurate touch pad two finger sliding gesture / imitating the wheel operation of the mouse, which is convenient for a few applications with poor support for the two finger sliding of the touch pad, such as PTC Creo, which can use the simulated mouse wheel operation), Press the physical key on the lower edge of the touch panel with four fingers to switch the operation mode of the mouse like touch panel (when it is closed, it will revert to the original touch panel mode of the windows system to facilitate the use of other users who have not learned the operation method of the mouse like touch panel. At the same time, it can also reflect the power of the mouse like touch panel drive through comparison).

The multi-point capacitive touch pad can easily solve the wrong touch of the palm according to the shape of the contact surface of the touch point (the aspect ratio of the elliptical contact surface of the palm supported by the touch pad during typing is larger than that of the normal finger, so it is easy to eliminate the filter).

In addition, only the touch panel with Parallel Report Mode hardware has the function of switching back to the original windows touch panel operation mode. The problem with the original touch panel gesture operation of Hybrid ReportingMode hardware has not been solved, so the function of switching back to the original touch panel operation mode is not realized. The double finger sliding wheel operation has a jam, so the default setting is to imitate the mouse wheel mode.

The free experience beta driver uses an unofficially issued third-party digital signature certificate, so the windows security center will pop up a warning threat. Select "allow on the device" and no window will pop up. The officially issued shared charging version uses a Microsoft Certified Digital signature certificate. It is safer and easier to install without a warning pop-up window.
